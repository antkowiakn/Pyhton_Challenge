# Python_Challenge
I worked on two different challenges, and wrote two different scripts to complete the following:    
  
In the first challenge I created a python script to analyze some financial records. 
The script calculated the following:  
The total Number of Months included in the data.  
The net total amount of the Profit/Losses over the entire period.  
Calculated the changes in Profit/Losses and then found the average of the changes.  
Calulated the greatest increase in profits over the entire period.  
Calulated the greatest decrease in profits of the entire period.  
  
In the second challege I created a python script to analyze a voting counting process in a small town.  
The script analayzed the votes and caluclated the following:  
Total number of votes cast.  
A complete list of the candidates who received votes.  
The percentage of votes each candidate received.  
The total number of votes that each candidate received.  
The winner of the election based on the popular vote.
